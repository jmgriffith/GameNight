# GameNight Workflow & Page Reference

A developer-facing map of every page in the GameNight app: where it lives, who can reach it, what it does, and how users get to it. Companion to `DOCS.md` (which is the end-user/admin guide).

App version at time of writing: **0.05300**
All page files live in `www/`. Data endpoints (`*_dl.php`) are listed but not detailed here — they exist only to serve AJAX from the page that owns them.

## Dev → Git → Live Release Flow

Changes ride through three environments before users see them:

1. **Edit in `/home/bryce/Claude/GameNight`** — the source-of-truth working copy that pushes to GitHub.
2. **Mirror to `/home/bryce/Claude/GameNight-dev`** — every file touched in step 1 is copied to the same relative path in the dev clone, which runs the `gamenight-dev` container at **http://localhost:8080**. The mirror is per-edit, not a bulk rsync, so dev's local experiments and downloaded vendor files stay intact. Excluded from mirroring: `docker-compose.yml`, `config/config.php`, `db/`, `uploads/`, `vendor/`, `phpadmin/`, `.git/`.
3. **Verify locally** at http://localhost:8080. PHP/static edits are picked up live via the bind-mount; if a rebuild is needed, run `docker compose up -d --build` in `GameNight-dev`.
4. **Push to git** *only after* the change is confirmed in dev: `git add` + `git commit` + `git push` from `GameNight`.
5. **Deploy to live** by SSHing to `root@gamenight.poker` and running `git pull` (followed by `docker compose down && up -d --build` if the change requires a rebuild). Never scp from Windows — CRLF line endings corrupt PHP files.

## 9. Quick Workflow Cheatsheet

**New user signs up:**
`register.php` → email → `verify_email.php` → `login.php` → `index.php`

**Host runs a poker night:**
`calendar.php` (create event, mark as poker) → `walkin_display.php` (QR on iPad) → guests use `walkin.php` → host uses `checkin.php` → `timer.php` runs the clock → optional remote `timer.php?view=remote&key=…` for spectators.

**Invitee RSVPs from email:**
Email link → `rsvp.php?token=…&r=yes` → done (creator notified).

**Admin tunes the site:**
Nav → `admin_settings.php` → pick a tab. Posts/announcements live separately in `admin_posts.php`.

**Password reset:**
`login.php` → `forgot_password.php` → email → `reset_password.php` → `login.php`.
