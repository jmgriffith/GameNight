        <h3>Leagues</h3>
        <p>Create private leagues for your poker group, board game crew, or any circle. Build a roster, invite members by email or shareable link, and keep your events and contacts separate from other groups on the site.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-card">
        <div class="icon">&#128101;</div>
        <h3>Roster Management</h3>
        <p>Add members by name and email — even before they sign up. Import your whole roster via CSV. Pending contacts auto-link when they create an account, becoming full members instantly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-card">
        <div class="icon">&#128197;</div>
        <h3>Event Scheduling</h3>
        <p>Create events scoped to your league or just your personal invite list. Set dates, times, and visibility. Only members and invitees see what's meant for them — no comingled calendars.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-card">
        <div class="icon">&#9989;</div>
        <h3>RSVP Management</h3>
        <p>One-click RSVPs from email or text. See who's in, who's out, and who's on the fence. Automatic reminders keep your headcount accurate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-card">
        <div class="icon">&#127922;</div>
        <h3>Tournament Tools</h3>
        <p>Full-screen tournament timer with customizable blind structures, player check-in, table assignments, random seating, and payout calculators (ICM, Standard, Chip Chop).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-card">
        <div class="icon">&#128202;</div>
        <h3>Player Stats &amp; Leaderboard</h3>
        <p>Track every player's games, wins, finish positions, and weighted scores across tournaments. Filter the leaderboard by date range to compare recent form against lifetime stats.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-card">
        <div class="icon">&#128241;</div>
        <h3>Walk-in QR Registration</h3>
        <p>Generate a QR code for public events. Guests scan, register in seconds, and get assigned a table and seat — no app download required.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-card">
        <div class="icon">&#128274;</div>
        <h3>Privacy &amp; Approval Controls</h3>
        <p>League events stay private to members. Join-request approval lets owners vet newcomers. Host approval mode queues walk-ins and self-signups for your review before they're on the list.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-card">
        <div class="icon">&#128176;</div>
        <h3>Multi-Table &amp; Payouts</h3>
        <p>Seat players across multiple tables, balance on the fly, protect button positions, break up tables as the field shrinks, and display live payout structures on the timer screen.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-card">
        <div class="icon">&#128276;</div>
        <h3>Smart Notifications</h3>
        <p>Email, SMS, and WhatsApp — each person picks their preference. Invites, RSVP confirmations, reminders, league requests, and approval alerts all routed automatically.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-card">
        <div class="icon">&#128227;</div>
        <h3>Posts &amp; Comments</h3>
        <p>Share announcements, pin important updates, and let your group discuss. Rich-text editor, comment threads, and a pinned-post feed on the home page.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-card">

        <h3>WordPress &amp; API</h3>
        <p>Got a WordPress site for your league? Drop in our <strong>GameNight League</strong> plugin to render events, posts, roster, rules, and RSVP forms as shortcodes anywhere on your site. On a different stack? The same data is one bearer-auth REST call away — read-scope keys for display, write-scope keys let your site mint new accounts.</p>
